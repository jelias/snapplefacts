# Snapple Facts

Snapple Facts is a website that has every single snapple fact. Yeah, all 989.

## Author

I, [Jacob Elias](https://github.com/jelias) made this little site.

Follow me & ask questions [@jelias](https://twitter.com/_jelias_)

Feel free to contribute: fork, make pull requests, and issues as this is 100% still under development!

### Credits

Huge thanks to [Galen Gidman's](http://galengidman.com/) for leaving his code out to dry (putting his code on github). This site is largely based off of an old fork of his [Everybioever](https://github.com/galengidman/everybioever) repo. 

> NOTE: I plan to re-code and add some more features to the site when I'm done learning how to. (School is kinda getting in the way.)
